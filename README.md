# aphelia, the minimalist window manager

This project was previously a work of satire, going under a different name, however I have decided to continue the project as it seems functional and ready to be improved upon.

This window manager is single-file and a super small binary with low resource consumption. Personally, I find it's useful for focused work where you aren't moving around too much and don't need multiple workspaces (it doesn't support them, obviously).

## Default key-binds.

 * Push window backwards `Alt+a`
 * Pull window forward `Alt+s`
 * Kill window `Alt+q`
 * Open (Suckless) *Simple Terminal (st)* `Alt+Return`
 * Open *dmenu* `Alt+d`
 * Kill window manager `Alt+Backspace`
 * Move windows `Alt+Left Click`
 * Resize windows `Alt+Right Click`

New key-binds are currently added by editing `aphelia.c` and re-compiling. It's actually pretty self-explanatory as the code is quite repetetive. Couple copy-pastes, tops.
